offer: "RuDASA is a growing network of rural health care professionals, and we invite applications for membership. Due to the fact that RuDASA is a special interest group of the South African Medical Association, we are geared primarily towards doctors working in or interested in rural medicine, whether generalists or specialists, in private or in public. However, membership is also open to all medical or other health practitioners (including allied health professionals and students, at a discounted rate) involved in the practice, training or support of rural medicine."
