A major part of RuDASA's function is to provide support for doctors working in remote areas; from networking to advocacy on key issues. Here you will find a growing collection of resources and references. We have a Public Library, including access to our COVID-19 library on Google Drive, and a more extensive members-only library in the [Onboarding Section](https://rudasa.org.za/portal).
