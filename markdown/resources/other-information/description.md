A major part of RuDASA's function is to provide support for doctors working in remote areas; from networking to advocacy on key issues. Here you will find a growing collection of resources and references and information on  our partners and projects.  
RuDASA members can also check out our [Rural Onboarding](/portal) Section for an online, structured orientation program with complete resources  for clinical rural health care.
