firstPoint: "From 2018 RuDASA has committed to develop a 'Survive & Thrive' mentoring programme to support Interns and Young Doctors. The emphasis is on helping young doctors transition from their student role and adapt to working in rural areas. We hope that our enthusiastic rural champions will help make the transition day, and inspire you to be part of the  #Imstayingrural cohort!"
secondPoint: "This programme includes access to our Learning Portal, sharing with colleagues through Doctor Dialogue and the occasional Rural Doctors Retreat. Our first Rural Doctors Retreat was held in Eastern Cape in 2020 and looked at preventing Burnout, how to VOICE your concerns, and beginning to create your own rural network. participants recommended that this be an annual event and be rolled out to the other provinces. In 2021 Eastern Cape extended their orientation programme to a 6 week 'OnBoarding' series of lecturers and resources."
