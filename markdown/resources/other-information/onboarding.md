abstractTitle: "Learn how to thrive, not just survive, in rural health!"
abstract: "Welcome to RuDASA's  comprehensive online package for new clinicians joining rural health facilities in South Africa. COVID has transformed our training landscape and we are now able to offer an orientation program that can fit in with a clinician’s busy program, and still give them access to all the knowledge and resources they need to thrive in rural health care. Although focused on new clinicians we welcome any clinician keen to update their knowledge.

---attendance
At the moment the clinical part of the program is heavily focused on doctors and clinical associates, but the orientation package is open to any new clinician in South Africa. The sections on employee support, the MDT team, health care worker mental health and patient centred care are particularly relevant to any new health care worker, but feel free to attend other sessions. Although this program caters for new professionals we are very happy for existing colleagues to participate in topics they feel would be useful (including interns and students). We are applying for CPD points for the webinars.
