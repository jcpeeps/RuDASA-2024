**Rural OnBoarding Annual programme late January to March: "Learn how to thrive, not just survive, in rural health!"**

Welcome to RuDASA's  comprehensive online package for new clinicians joining rural health facilities in South Africa. COVID has transformed our training landscape and we are now able to offer an orientation program that can fit in with a clinician’s busy program, and still give them access to all the knowledge and resources they need to thrive in rural health care. Although focused on new clinicians we welcome any clinician keen to update their knowledge. 

A 8-week curriculum, structured into six broad categories, using a hybrid teaching methodology. Each Monday you will be sent the program for the coming week, including the links to the relevant zoom meetings; as well as links to relevant webinars, video tutorials, and related guidelines, protocols and tools useful to your daily work. These  can be studied at home at a time that suits you and clinicians can tailor their learning according to their needs. Clinicians are encouraged to attend the interactive Zoom sessions on Monday evenings (with additional sessions later in the week depending on facilitator availability). These will Introduce key mentors and experts that can provide ongoing support as the course progresses. We will cover FAQ and top tips on the materials you have received.

Sessions are on a Monday or Tuesday at 18.00 using Zoom.

**Overview**

There are three “types” of orientation topics: 
1. Understanding the DOH working environment skills pertaining to team work, mental well being & patient centred care (all cadres)
2. Top tips for Medical cadres, and FAQ on fields such as HIV, TB, Obstetrics, neonatal and paediatric care, anaesthetics, orthopaedics and trauma and much more. 
3. Weekly topics and material that will be uploaded and if you miss the session you can watch on YouTube.

This course is a work in progress Follow us on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter to get noice of upcoming On-Boarding sessions.

Week 1 : Infectious Diseases  
Week 2: Maternal Medicine  
Week 3: Adult Medicine  
Week 4: Child Health  
Week 5: Emergency Medicine  
Week 6: Trauma, Anaesthetics and Surgery  
Week 7: Mental health  
Week 8: Family medicine Skills and navigating the NDOH  

At the moment the clinical part of the program is heavily focused on doctors and clinical associates, but the orientation package is open to any new clinician in South Africa. The sections on employee support, the MDT team, health care worker mental health and patient centred care are particularly relevant to any new health care worker, but feel free to attend other sessions. Although this program caters for new professionals we are very happy for existing colleagues to participate in topics they feel would be useful (including interns and students). We are applying for CPD points for the webinars.

We are receiving excellent feedback from our rural network of clinicians on useful information to add. We will be updating our materials and links on a weekly bases. We are also open to requests, input and feedback.
