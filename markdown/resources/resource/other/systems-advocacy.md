title: 'Systems & Advocacy'

**Rural Health Services deserve to be as good as urban service delivery, with the same ratio of health workers, resources, and care pathways.** 
RuDASA advocates for good quality rural health services at Local, Provincial and National Fora. There are a number of resources on NDoH Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs), National Core Standards (NCS), and Tools for Quality Improvement (QI). We recognise that you may be working in less than optimal situations and have identified organisations that can advocate for you when we cannot help you. Remember you can VOICE concerns on the Forum or contact the RuDASA Executive directly.

## Getting Help for Advocacy
 
### The VOICE Project
The Voice Project is part of RHAP and aims to improve access to quality rural health care by increasing the number and quality of healthcare provider change agents. As part of this initiative, RHAP provides free of charge CPD accredited Advocacy workshops in institutions of learning and at facility level.

### The StopStockOuts Project
The Stop Stockouts Project (SSP) is a consortium of initiated by Section 27, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the Rural Health Advocacy Project (RHAP), Rural Health Doctors Association of Southern Africa (RuDASA), the Southern African HIV Clinician Society and the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) dedicated to assisting the thousands of people whose lives are threatened by the chronic shortages of essential medicines and children’s vaccines in South Africa. They have an annual survey and you can contact them to report Stockouts.

### SECTION27
SECTION27 is a public interest law centre that seeks to achieve substantive equality and social justice in South Africa. Guided by the principles and values in the Constitution, SECTION27 uses law, advocacy, legal literacy, research and community mobilisation to achieve access to healthcare services and basic education. SECTION27 aims to achieve structural change and accountability to ensure the dignity and equality of everyone.
