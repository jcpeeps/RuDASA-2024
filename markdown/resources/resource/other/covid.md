### About the Presenters  
**Dr Jeremy Nel** 

Jeremy graduated with an MBChB from University of the Witwatersrand in 2006, and thereafter specialized in internal medicine at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he later also completed a fellowship in infectious diseases. He was awarded a Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene from the Royal College of Physicians with distinction in 2017 and recently completed a fellowship in transplant infectious diseases at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He is an active member of the Southern African HIV Clinicians Society, and has been involved in several guidelines committees including the adult antiretroviral therapy guidelines, cryptococcal meningitis guidelines and transplant HIV guidelines. He has published research in the fields of tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacteria, HIV and cryptococcal meningitis.

**Dr Hans Hendriks**  

Hans joined Zithulele Hospital in 2016, tasked with spearheading the implementation of the Family Medicine registrar programme. His undergraduate and postgraduate studies were through Stellenbosch University. He worked at Ceres Hospital for 10 years before relocating to us. True to type as a Family Physician, he enjoys all spheres of medicine, especially obstetrics, surgery and emergency medicine. Outside of work he is an avid mountain biker, enjoys spearfishing and is learning to surf - he's loving not being in a city, or even a town. Deep down inside, though, he's Handyman Hans.
