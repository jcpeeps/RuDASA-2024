**Introduction:** There is a wide range of surgical procedures possibly within a district hospital setting and there is a drive an interest to widen the scope of what is currently available in our rural settings. Limits are partly set by available resources, but also by the confidence of the surgeon. This field is under review at the moment and there are amazing mentors exploring how to introduce a surgical basket of care into district health systems.
