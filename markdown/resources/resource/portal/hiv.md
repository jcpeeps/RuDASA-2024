## Cutting Edge HIV Management
HIV is a very structured public health program and there are high quality government guidelines (see below). 

### Mentoring and Support

The HIV program falls under Family Medicine and is managed through the clinic / district hospital infra-structure as a primary health care program. Your first port of call when needing help is therefore your local DCST Family physician, local experts in your ARV clinics and the HIV hotline. Our ID colleagues usually assist us when we see HIV patients with complicated opportunistic infections. SA HIV Clinicians Society, Medicines Information Centre, and the Foundation for Professional Development also have great resources (see below).

### Organizations Specializing in HIV Management
The [Southern African HIV Clinicians Society](https://sahivsoc.org/) is a membership organisation for health care professionals. The Society supports and strengthens the capacity of its members to deliver high quality HIV prevention, care and treatment services. They also have [ART Guidelines](https://sahivsoc.org/Guidelines/GuidelinesLandingPage), [discussion groups](https://sahivsoc.org/Subheader/Index/discussion-groups) and a list of [clinical case studies](https://www2.sahivsoc.org/Subheader/Index/clinical-case-studies).
RuDASA recognises SAHIVSoc as the Best Practice experts in HIV. They keep the up to date guidelines, have a journal for doctors, and one for nurses, and run CPD events.
If HIV is your thing then it is definitely worthwhile joining the SAHIVSOC for excellent publications.
 	
The [Medicines Information Centre and National HIV & TB HCW Hotline](www.mic.uct.ac.za) is in the Division of Clinical Pharmacology at UCT. They offer a free medicine-related query-answering service to health care workers and have developed many tools to assist including guideline posters, an EML-Antiretrovirals Interactions Table and several ADE management tools. These are all available for free as hard copies, electronically on their [website](www.mic.uct.ac.za) and on their SA HIV/TB [hotline app](https://youtu.be/NlC3CTrNxRw). If the App does not work on your line keep trying as they do updates.

FPD has created [this free online CPD course](https://www.mpconsulting.co.za/products/online-cme/1702/hiv-and-tb-for-health-care-professionals-in-the-era-of-covid-19) on HIV / TB for health care professionals during COVID. There are 3 modules of 1-2 hrs released in February 2021.

The [Southern African Journal of HIV Medicine](https://sajhivmed.org.za/index.php/hivmed) is focused on HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention and related topics relevant to clinical and public health practice. The purpose of the journal is to disseminate original research results and to support high-level learning related to HIV Medicine. It publishes original research articles, editorials, case reports/case series, reviews of state-of-the-art clinical practice, and correspondence.

Since 2010, the Southern African HIV Clinicians Society has produced a magazine specifically for nurses working in HIV; [HIV Nursing Matters](https://sahivsoc.org/Subheader/Index/hiv-nursing-matters-). The magazine is led by an Editorial Advisory Board, and serves as a resource for nurses in the region providing HIV services, including the initiation and management of antiretroviral treatment.
