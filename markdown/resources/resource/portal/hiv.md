**Introduction:** Infectious diseases still make up a significant bulk of our clinical workload. Although
we have made massive strides in HIV and TB over the last decade, these are still the most common
infectious diseases you will see – and the landscape is always changing. Are you up to date?

## 5 HIV / TB Work Based Activities to focus on this week. How confident are you in

* Identify and manage virological failure in a patient on first and second line treatment in adults and children

* Work up of the sick, immunocompromised patient

* Work-up of the TB suspect with a GeneXpert negative result.

* Key PMTCT intervention in the pregnant women, during labor and in the neonate to prevent mother to child transmission.

* Managing the patient with the positive CLAT – including cryptococcal meningitis

* Managing the patient that presents with an abnormal LFT (TB IRIS VS DILI)
