    The hashtag ( # ) symbols followed by a space and then text show a heading. The more #s you have, the smaller/"less important" the heading. You can add up to 6 # but we suggest max 4 #. make sure each heading is on a separate line.

    The text surrounded by double  stars ( ** ) with no space show bold text.
