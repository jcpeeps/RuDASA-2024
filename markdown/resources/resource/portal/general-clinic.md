**Introduction:** There are several resources useful to have in the back pocket. Make sure that they are all available off line (e.g. save them in PDF format or download them for off line use in the apps). Chat to your colleagues at the hospital about apps they find useful.

## Key Guidelines

* Your biggest friend is the EMG app: [Emguidance](https://emguidance.com/): go to the guidelines tab and add all the guidelines that you want to be able to access off line – internet can be fickle! This includes your all your EMLs as well as ART guidelines etc.

* A great resource is the Zithulele handbook – curated yearly! Free to download (with some other great resources) – this is worthwhile to having access to

* PHC EML 2020 [Knowledgehub-Primary Health](https://knowledgehub.health.gov.za/elibrary/primary-healthcare-phc-standard-treatment-guidelines-stgs-and-essential-medicines-list-eml)

* Adults hospital STG and EML 2019: [Knowledgehub-Adults Hospital](https://knowledgehub.health.gov.za/elibrary/hospital-level-adults-standard-treatment-guidelines-stgs-and-essential-medicines-list-eml)

* Paeds hospital STG and EML 2023: [Knowledgehub-Paediatrics](https://knowledgehub.health.gov.za/elibrary/hospital-level-paediatric-standard-treatment-guidelines-stgs-and-essential-medicines-list)

* APC (adult primary care guide) 2019/2020 is a great primary care resource often useful in a outpatient setting. Download the ebook version – where you can click on page / tab numbers for quick access. Great for quick reminders on e.g. STI syndromic treatments - [Knowledgehub-Adult Primary Care](https://knowledgehub.health.gov.za/elibrary/adult-primary-care-apc-guide-20192020-updated)

* IMCI is the child version of the APC. If you are not confident on managing the ill child in primary care – this is a great resource. [Knowledgehub-IMCI](https://knowledgehub.health.gov.za/elibrary/integrated-management-childhood-illness-imci-2019-updated)

* Calculate by QxMD - a great collection of tools for all your calculations including eGFR, QT intervals, BMI, scores of every kind, DAS28, etc. etc. [QxMD Calculate](https://qxmd.com/calculate/) There is also an app.
  * VULA app: an app to refer and discuss cases and is being used by more and more consultants and hospitals. Vula&#39;s team is dedicated to improving communication challenges, especially in the public health sector, see the feature on Carte Blanche [Watch Here](https://youtu.be/YI7-1N6qPnM)
  * If you would like your department to use Vula just complete the form on this page: [Vula Form](https://bit.ly/3s3WqYT)

* Medicine information centre (used to be known as the HIV hotline) – great page for resources and a hotline for queries of any kind. [Medicine Information centre](http://www.mic.uct.ac.za/)

Here is [RuDASA Library General Resource Pack](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1srnPoOjfkWm7UFMTxTL-PyRhEF93oAC-)

* APC ebook

* EML Paeds

* EML hospital adults

* Yandisa isiChosa phrase packs

## Do you only speak English?

Good communication is essential! And that means becoming acquainted with at least 1 or 2 additional South African languages over and above English.

The best way is to practice in a consultation setting. Find a good basic course that teaches you how the language is constructed and then find phrase packs e.g. on history taking or general examination or advise on how to take medicines etc.

When I first started out I asked an enthusiastic colleague to record me 10 phrases as at time (first English and then isiXhosa) on a recorder (now even easier with recording apps), which I would then practice in the care on the way to work.

I have plenty of resources here for isiXhosa as I am based in the Eastern Cape – and add in my recommendations below, but feel free to research resources for the language in your area.

* **Ubuntu bridge**: for isiXhosa and isiZulu. Expensive but first class to get to know the language inside out. [Learn Xhosa](https://www.learnxhosa.co.za/)

* **Speak easy Xhosa**: This moodle based online platform has a specific course for health care workers and pharmacists made up out of phrase packs. Basic but very well populated with phrases commonly used in the consultation room

* **Yandisa training**: this is a course I created with a local isiXhosa teacher, Phelisa Soxujwa. It was focusing on teenagers (my own included) and beginner Xhosa speakers and not specifically medical. Cheap and very homegrown( R350 per level) with Youtube Grammer videos, phrase packs and audio recordings. Contact [Dr Muller](mailto:drmullerbz@gmail.com) for more information. I’ve included some phrase packs in the google folder

**If you know of any great resources out there on any of the other South Africa languages, please send to me at mentor@rudasa.org.za so that I can add to further packs.**
