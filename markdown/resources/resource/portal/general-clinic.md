#### Introduction

    There are several resources useful to have in the back pocket. Make sure that they are
    all available off line (e.g. save them in PDF format or download them for off line use in the apps).
    Chat to your colleagues at the hospital about apps they find useful.

#### Key Guidelines

- Your biggest friend is the EMG app: https://emguidance.com/: go to the guidelines tab and
    add all the guidelines that you want to be able to access off line – internet can be fickle! This
      includes your all your EMLs as well as ART guidelines etc.
