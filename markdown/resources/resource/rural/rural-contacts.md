We are developing our Rural Champion's and Rural Buddy systems. In the meantime here are some rural specific organisations and journals.

Whats a **Rural champion**? These are rural veterans willing to share their knowledge of DoH systems and how to use the systems as well as giving advice about "what to do" in clinical situations.

The **Rural Buddies** is an email or WhatsApp Group of RuDASA members in your District.

For support on specific conditions go to the Clinical Resources to find associations and organisations working in that clinical field.
