**Help I'm going rural!**

If you are an intern about to take up a community service post in a rural hospital or just moving to a rural area read our [info for community service](/pdfs/RuDASA%20Information%20for%20Community%20Service%20doctors%20June%202023.pdf) for helpful tips so you will survive and thrive in rural. Once you are there look out for our annual [OnBoarding Programme webinars](/resources/other-information/onboarding.md) on what you need to know to survive in a district hospital.


**Taking Care** is a group of doctors (2 are rural doctors) that run a variety of wellness workshops , online and at venues, to prevent Burnout & depression in health care workers. You can do a quick check on the site to see if you have Burnout. There are a number of good resources on the web.
