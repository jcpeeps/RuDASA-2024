    This is a comment and is not displayed on the website. Do not alter this text between arrows (->).
    To change the content in this file, simply retype/ copy+paste any text above, as you would in a normal text file/ word document.

    Do not change the "title:" title, or the ---. Only change the text inside '' for that section.

    The hashtag ( # ) symbols followed by a space and then text show a heading. The more #s you have, the smaller/"less important" the heading. You can add up to 6 # but we suggest max 4 #. make sure each heading is on a separate line.

    The text surrounded by double  stars ( ** ) with no spaces shows bold text.
