### [RHC Website](https://www.ruralhealthconference.org.za/)
Since 1996 RuDASA organised an annual rural doctors conference in a rural town which attracted a range of rural health professionals from all over the country. In 2014 it became the Rural Health Conference as it had far outgrown it's original brief, and in 2017 it became a joint project with RuReSA, PACASA and RuNurSA.

The conference is a much-anticipated, vibrant forum which combines a mixture of sessions ranging from clinical skills updates for and by a wide range of health professionals to emotive discussions and workshops on issues such as justice and equity. The conference is ideal for exchanging ideas and is ideal for networking. Younger colleagues and students are also encouraged to attend.

A highlight of the conference is the gala Dinner and Award Ceremony in which doctors, nurses, clinical associates and therapists are recognised for their outstanding role in rural health.
