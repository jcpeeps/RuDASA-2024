**Please note that RuDASA unfortunately does not have funds for scholarships but you could try crowdfunding!**

RuDASA supports the concept of scholarship schemes for health sciences students that are linked to rural districts, as a long-term strategy for the recruitment and retention of doctors and other health care professionals. We advocate for provincial bursaries to be devolved to local level so that such linking can take place. This is based on the fact that local research has confirmed the international findings that people from rural areas are more likely to practice there. Pilot schemes have also already been developed and provide a model for this. 2 pilot schemes have been initiated:

* The Friends of Mosvold Scholarship Scheme
* The Wits Initiative for Rural Health Education

Should you wish to develop a similar programme or support these scholarship schemes through direct contributions or assistance with fundraising efforts, please [contact us](/contact).
