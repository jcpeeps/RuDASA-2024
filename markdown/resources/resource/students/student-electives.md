## Foreign Student Electives

Foreign students hoping to do an elective in South Africa have to do this through one of the universities. If you have a particular hospital or Province in mind we can link you to the university that works in that area. 

Foreign Students need to contact these International Offices directly to register as an elective student in South Africa:

* [Sefako Makgatho Health Science University (Gauteng)](http://www.smu.ac.za/students/international-students/)
* [University of Cape Town (Western Cape)](http://www.healthelectives.uct.ac.za/applications/elective-placements)

    To change the content in this file, simply retype/ copy+paste any text above, as you would in a normal text file/ word document.

    Do not change the "title:" title, or the ---. Only change the text inside '' for that section.

    The hashtag ( # ) symbols followed by a space and then text show a heading. The more #s you have, the smaller/"less important" the heading. You can add up to 6 # but we suggest max 4 #. make sure each heading is on a separate line.

    The text surrounded by double  stars ( ** ) with no spaces shows bold text.

    The single star ( * ) followed by a space and then text shows an item in a bulleted list. Make sure each item is on a separate line.
    
    Links are created by putting the text you want to show in square brackets ( [] ) followed by the link in round brackets ( () ). For example, [RuReSA](https://ruresa.org.za/) will show as RuReSA and link to the RuReSA website.
