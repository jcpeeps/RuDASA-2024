As part of our commitment to mentoring rural clinicians we are developing a Learning Portal for RuDASA members.The Learning Portal aims to be a quick way to find out about courses that suit rural doctors needs, best practice information , and mentorship by Rural Champions. This is a new development so we welcome any suggestions.  The portal includes access to guidelines, videos, courses, and rural "champions" in 7 categories that are essential to being a good rural clinician, understanding the Department of Health, and to keep you mentally healthy. At the moment the portal is in the early stages of development.
