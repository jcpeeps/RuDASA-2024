#### Contribution

Since its establishment, RuDASA has aimed to create awareness of the plight, challenges and successes of rural doctors and other health professionals by implementing various advocacy strategies. These range from open letters and press statements, often with partner organizations, to making inputs into policy developments, and advising and supporting rural health care workers with local health care service delivery challenges.

#### Partnerships

Amongst its core partners are SECTION27 and Wits Centre for Rural Health with whom RuDASA formed the Rural Health Advocacy Project in 2009. In this new partnership RuDASA has taken up and contributed to many advocacy issues; including the rural-proofing of the Primary Health Care Revitalisation Strategy, advocacy around OSD and the Minimum Service Level Agreement, formulation of and advocacy for short and long term rural recruitment and retention strategies and the freezing of medical posts, to name a few.
