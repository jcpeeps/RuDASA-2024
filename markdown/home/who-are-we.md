about: 'The Rural Doctors Association of Southern Africa (RuDASA) strives inspire others towards rural healthcare in South Africa. Our aim is to support and empower those committed to making health care available to all South Africans.'
vision: 'RuDASA began in 1996 with a group of vocal, dedicated and passionate rural doctors, initially based in KwaZulu-Natal. We have since gained members from across the country, resulting in a dynamic, membership-based organization which strives for better health care in rural areas.'
mission: 'RuDASA is here to help. We are a network of professionals: many are from rural facilities and university-linked rural health centres across South Africa, working on the ground with an in-depth understanding of the challenges faced by rural doctors. Thus, RuDASA combines skills and experience in order to support our members, give them a voice, connect them to each other, and promote knowledge transfer.'
