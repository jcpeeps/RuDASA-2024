RuDASA has an active Executive Committee, as well as a National Advisory Committee of Provincial Representatives and Portfolio bearers. The committee administrates and manages RuDASA through transparent and inclusive mechanisms that encourage all RuDASA members to contribute their experiences and opinions.

Provincial Representatives function as a link between provincial health care workers and the RuDASA Executive committee. The reps report provincial issues that require RuDASA attention to the National Advisory Committee and communicate back to provincial health care workers/members. The reps coordinate the Provincial RuDASA Committee and facilitate periodical provincial committee meetings by telecon or otherwise. 

The reps also act as the face for RuDASA in the province for local health care workers, government, stakeholders and the media, and represent RuDASA in provincial events, such as meetings with the Provincial Department of Health.

Provinces are encouraged to set up provincial committees to reach more health care workers via email and teleconferences, in order to amplify grassroots voices at a national level, provide feedback from the national committee and to obtain representative opinions on key issues from health care workers at district &amp; sub-district level. This improves transparency, and ensures that the issues at district level link with the national committee.
