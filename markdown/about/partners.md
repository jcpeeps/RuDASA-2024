        title: 'Rural Health Advocacy Project:',
        description: 'RHAP is a partnership initiative between the Rural Doctors Association of Southern Africa (RuDASA), the Wits Centre for Rural Health (WCRH) and Section27, incorporating the AIDS Law Project. RHAP’s work revolves around the constitutional right of rural and remote communities to have equitable access to comprehensive, quality health care. The RHAP aims to facilitate self-advocacy, generate debate, monitor implementation of health policies in rural areas, and influence pro-equity decision-making that is in tune with local rural realities. Since the RHAP was established in September 2009, the project started a number of advocacy strategies in partnership with various stakeholders. These include advocacy for rural health workforce recruitment and retention; documenting and reporting health system challenges in rural areas, such as drug-stock outs and moratoria on the filling of posts; and facilitating a consensus building process of rural health care challenges and priorities among a panel of rural health care experts. RHAP’s overall purpose is to advocate for improved health care in and for rural communities. Central to quality rural health care is the primary health care (PHC) approach and the district health system. RHAP moderates the RuDASA Forum mailing-list. RuDASA members may also contact RHAP directly to discuss particular issues affecting rural health care in their areas',
