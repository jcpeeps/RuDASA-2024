Rural Health Matters outreach campaign is a surgical outreach project initiated in 2020 aimed at reduction of surgical backlog within the province. The project was inspired by a wish of Limpopo DOH MEC Dr P.C Ramathuba to have ophthalmic patient operated and have their sight restored at Elim Hospital (her birthplace) on her birthday. During her remarks following a successful implementation of the project, The MEC coined a phrase "Rural health does matter". 

The phrase became the spark that lit the flames that is now Rural Health Matters Outreach Campaign The project has since inception seen more than 7000 documented operations for Ophthalmology, Paediatrics surgery, Plastics surgery, Maxillofacial surgery, Orthopaedics, Urology, Gynaecology, ENT and General surgery. The radiology procedures such as formal sonography and CT scans reportings are also conducted during the program. The project is hosted in the 5 Districts of Limpopo Province for the duration of a week on a rotational basis for 10 months of the year. The theatre infrastructure in the 41 District and Regional Hospitals is utilized by Specialists and Medical Officers in both private and public sector who volunteer their surgical and anaesthetics skills. 

The project has also become a training and/or capacitation platform for some specialty Departments, with the highlight being University of Free State Orthopaedics Department which has consistently sent a group of their Registrars and Specialists to upskill them on Hip and knee arthroplasties. The greatest Ruralitarian as he often referred to himself, and the late Provincial coordinator Dr D.S Mokumo has always prided the project to being "The Gift that keeps on giving", and in 2022 a total of 2 221 patients were operated by these Doctors. This is a gift to 2 221 families whose lives were positively impacted by the volunteer spirits.
