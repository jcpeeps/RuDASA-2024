RuDASA also acknowledged the lifetime achievement of Dr Reynier Ter Haar, a South African doctor who’s been based at Nkhoma Hospital in Central Malawi for the past 18 years. In the past 4 years he’s been actively involved in initiatives to improve the quality of care and quality of life for people in the surrounding area, as well as strengthening the links between rural medicine and Family Medicine training for Malawian medical students. His list of achievements include developing a program for Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) for malaria control that has seen significant reductions in the number of paediatric admissions to the hospital since 2012. Through Dr Ter Haar’s leadership, Nkhoma Hospital became the first CHAM (Christian Hospital Association of Malawi) hospital to enter into a service level agreement with the Ministry of Health to provide free care to maternity and under five patients in the hospital catchment area and for referral of these patients needing hospital care at no cost to the patient. In addition, Dr Ter Haar’s cervical cancer screening program, developed in partnership with Edinburgh Global Health Academy and Lothian NHS UK, is set to become the model program for cervical cancer screening in the country.
