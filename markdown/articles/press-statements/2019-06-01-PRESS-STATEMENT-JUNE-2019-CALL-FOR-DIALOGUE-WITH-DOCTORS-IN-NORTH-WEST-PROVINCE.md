description: "RUDASA supports the principle that all doctors are responsible for using “best practice” for direct patient intervention, as well as ensuring appropriate health services for their local population. In order for this to happen doctors need to have the support of their line managers/district manager/provincial managers, as well as adequate budget and/or resources."
