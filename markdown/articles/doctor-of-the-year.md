Dr Bukiwe Spondo worked at Tafalofefe Distrcit Hospital, Eastern Cape from 2007. The hospital is in a deeply impoverished , if beautiful area, of Centane village. It is not easily accessible due to the poor condition of the roads, and with rains even staff have difficulty going to work because of the mud. She was nominated for the Award by the CEO and her co-workers who highlighted her dedication, hard work and caring for people in their community. 

Bukiwe started at the Masibambane ARV Clinic.  To make life easier for patients she started prepacking medication to take to the clinics for patients to collect, previously these patients had to travel to Butterworth for treatment. When this clinic closed she opened a CHAMP (Clinical HIV /AIDS Management Programme) site at Tafalofefe Hospital to see the complicated cases from the clinics. Later she started multidisciplinary outreach visits for the 9 clinics in Centane, firstly on a monthly basis but later on a twice weekly basis and from here refers people with poor viral load to the hospital for admission and counselling. As the nearest TB hospital is over 160km away she developed a MDR Review clinic with the support of the Amatole District Team and Butterworth Hospital. Her working day starts at 7.00 and only finishes once all the patients have been seen both at the hospital and the clinics. For patients at the clinics she refers directly to Frere Hospital or Cecelia Mahkiwane Hospital as needed rather than Tafalofefe, thus saving them transport money. For the nurses she does weekly in service teaching. After noticing the high teenage preganancy rate she identified 2 schools that needed awareness raising and has organised health awareness days for them.

She adopted the HIV- AIDS orphan NGO Phakamisanani , paying school fees for those in need and supporting many of the orphans to train as nurses. Overall she has improved the health of those living in the area and has a special rapport with her patients and that is why we nominate her for Doctor of the Year.

Rural Health Matters outreach campaign is a surgical outreach project initiated in 2020 aimed at reduction of surgical backlog within the province. The project was inspired by a wish of Limpopo DOH MEC Dr P.C Ramathuba to have ophthalmic patient operated and have their sight restored at Elim Hospital (her birthplace) on her birthday. During her remarks following a successful implementation of the project, The MEC coined a phrase "Rural health does matter". The phrase became the spark that lit the flames that is now Rural Health Matters Outreach Campaign The project has since inception seen more than 7000 documented operations for Ophthalmology, Paediatrics surgery, Plastics surgery, Maxillofacial surgery, Orthopaedics, Urology, Gynaecology, ENT and General surgery. The radiology procedures such as formal sonography and CT scans reportings are also conducted during the program. The project is hosted in the 5 Districts of Limpopo Province for the duration of a week on a rotational basis for 10 months of the year. The theatre infrastructure in the 41 District and Regional Hospitals is utilized by Specialists and Medical Officers in both private and public sector who volunteer their surgical and anaesthetics skills. The project has also become a training and/or capacitation platform for some specialty Departments, with the highlight being University of Free State Orthopaedics Department which has consistently sent a group of their Registrars and Specialists to upskill them on Hip and knee arthroplasties. The greatest Ruralitarian as he often referred to himself, and the late Provincial coordinator Dr D.S Mokumo has always prided the project to being "The Gift that keeps on giving", and in 2022 a total of 2 221 patients were operated by these Doctors. This is a gift to 2 221 families whose lives were positively impacted by the volunteer spirits.
