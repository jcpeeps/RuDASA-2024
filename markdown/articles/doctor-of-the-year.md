Dr Bukiwe Spondo worked at Tafalofefe Distrcit Hospital, Eastern Cape from 2007. The hospital is in a deeply impoverished , if beautiful area, of Centane village. It is not easily accessible due to the poor condition of the roads, and with rains even staff have difficulty going to work because of the mud. She was nominated for the Award by the CEO and her co-workers who highlighted her dedication, hard work and caring for people in their community. 

Bukiwe started at the Masibambane ARV Clinic.  To make life easier for patients she started prepacking medication to take to the clinics for patients to collect, previously these patients had to travel to Butterworth for treatment. When this clinic closed she opened a CHAMP (Clinical HIV /AIDS Management Programme) site at Tafalofefe Hospital to see the complicated cases from the clinics. Later she started multidisciplinary outreach visits for the 9 clinics in Centane, firstly on a monthly basis but later on a twice weekly basis and from here refers people with poor viral load to the hospital for admission and counselling. As the nearest TB hospital is over 160km away she developed a MDR Review clinic with the support of the Amatole District Team and Butterworth Hospital. Her working day starts at 7.00 and only finishes once all the patients have been seen both at the hospital and the clinics. For patients at the clinics she refers directly to Frere Hospital or Cecelia Mahkiwane Hospital as needed rather than Tafalofefe, thus saving them transport money. For the nurses she does weekly in service teaching. After noticing the high teenage preganancy rate she identified 2 schools that needed awareness raising and has organised health awareness days for them.

She adopted the HIV- AIDS orphan NGO Phakamisanani , paying school fees for those in need and supporting many of the orphans to train as nurses. Overall she has improved the health of those living in the area and has a special rapport with her patients and that is why we nominate her for Doctor of the Year.
