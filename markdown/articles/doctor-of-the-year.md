Andy, and his wife Sarah, arrived as a newlywed couple to Madwaleni Hospital in 2018, bright-eyed and filled with a passion to fulfil their calling at a rural hospital. He soon sought to make deeper impacts on local communities by specialising in Family Medicine, which he successfully achieved through the decentralised programme at WSU, qualifying cum laude for his remarkable research work. 

While dealing with some very real consequences of life in a rural hospital and the associated attrition of staff, he also had to navigate being a lone registrar without an official supervisor locally for extended periods of his training. As has become a defining feature of his character, he approached the challenge with determination and grit, not only passing his exit examinations successfully but winning the award for best presentation by a registrar upon delivery of his research at the SAAFP Annual National Family Physicians Conference. 

His research focussed on a key component of maternal and perinatal care, highlighting the safe use of vacuum-assisted vaginal deliveries (VAD) — an underutilised intervention in many settings which helps avoid dangerous second-stage Caesarean sections (CS). This research brings a vital rural voice to the national context where we know that many mothers die during CS at district hospitals all around South Africa. Maternal care remains a particular strength and passion of his, but does not limit his impact throughout the hospital, and indeed beyond to different levels of care at other facilities around the province, and all the way into communities. 

For instance, he has been a key part of a local team at Madwaleni who in recent years, in partnership with UCT’s Global Surgery unit and The Burn Care Trust, have established a Split-thickness Skin Graft (SSG) service to address the huge burden of burns we see especially in rural settings. This has overcome upstream challenges at tertiary facilities, to the point that these Mthatha facilities are now able to ‘down-refer’ their patients to rural Madwaleni for SSGs, and other district hospitals in the province have been inspired to replicate the model as well. Andy’s role in this has been remarkable, helping drive the service with his attitude of ‘Come guys, we can do it!’ — it is not uncommon to see Andy doing a ward round, then an SSG, before heading out on PHC outreach! 

Here we get to touch on how he has embraced the ethos of holistic practice in a rural setting, using his skills and every resource available to address a multitude of health needs we encounter in our rural settings. From working with ID specialists in schools to measure the undocumented burden of a neglected tropical disease like schistosomiasis, to working with nurses to educate youth in these schools about contraception to reduce the high teenage pregnancy rates we see. And then there’s all the work he’s been able to do in partnership with his wife Sarah, and her role as a remarkable rural therapist. 

Leveraging every available resource, Andy has been able to play another key enabling role in supporting projects in partnership with a local NPO, the Layita Foundation. From addressing low breastfeeding rates in First 1000 Day projects, to early education and literacy in a Nurturing Futures project. While Sarah has pioneered and led these projects, Andy has somehow managed to incorporate his roles in these vital aspects of community work into his busy everyday clinical load — often loading his personal vehicle for a busy PHC outreach with a MotherMentor to drop by for a quick breastfeeding support home visit along the way there, as well as some Layita library books to drop off during a high risk child’s home visit on the way back, and then some students to take along for good measure! 

He is also constantly striving not only to improve his own skills, or even those of his immediate colleagues, but even of those across our country as he aims to influence narratives from a rural context. His passion for the implementation of point-of-care ultrasound at the bedside in resource limited settings such as rural areas has driven his own learning and practice, but as of 2025 he has partnered with UCT, Stellenbosch University, and the Academy of Family Physicians to pilot a project where basic, and more advanced, ultrasound skills are taught as part of a systematic teaching programme to an entire complement of clinical staff at a rural hospital. 
With thanks to the Layita Foundation for assisting with subsidising costs, he is in the midst of mentoring the team through a programme of learning from the Global Ultrasound Institute. The aim is to see if this improves the confidence and clinical skills of the team, whether this translates to higher quality, and more efficient, care being offered to patients, and whether such a teaching model could be replicated at other facilities around the country. 

In the past few months, he has extended his already multifaceted role to include a more formal academic one as well, stepping into another key position coordinating the MMed programme of the WSU Dept of Family Medicine and Rural Health. His remarkable skills in teaching and administration, along with his profound experience of teaching and learning in a rural setting, have been recognised as he has taken on this significant responsibility with excellence and grace. 

Even more remarkable than his ability to find time for everything, is his commitment to making time for friends, colleagues, and family. As a senior in the Madwaleni clinical team, his role in supporting both fellow seniors and juniors, as well as colleagues across cadres from rehab services to nursing, is almost pastoral. It is small wonder that he also leads the local Church at the hospital — Madwaleni Church!

He is always available for a much-needed debrief, a thoughtful encouragement, and even at times a gentle nudge in a better direction, and he has taken on a huge role in building a culture of not only clinical excellence, but of thoughtful care — taking care of fellow HCWs as well as the communities of people we serve. His wise inputs during team discussions are matched only by his ability to also listen to other people’s points of view, an easily-overlooked skill in healthcare settings. 

His commitment to his rural Madwaleni community is unmatched. This was recently so clearly demonstrated when he offered up a well-deserved opportunity at applying for a Family Physician post, so that the Madwaleni team could benefit from an extra pair of hands — allowing a second Family Physician to be appointed while he continues to serve as a medical officer.

It is difficult to convey the impact Andy has had on the Madwaleni community, and indeed the wider healthcare community, over the past almost 8 years he has spent serving rural healthcare. While many of his endeavours have been remarkable, it is also simply having him ‘present’ every day that most will convey as the thing they appreciate most about him. Present with individual patients as he offers his characteristic evidence-based care with love and humour, and with colleagues as he offers his thoughtful and unwavering support. One nurse explained this essence so well when she described it like this: 

“I think one thing that marks Andy is his kind face and greetings - when you meet with him it’s almost as if he presents life with an essence of ‘Ubuntu’, he makes such an effort to try and understand people and each of their different cultures and beings, so as to really hear them and come with a solution that is relevant for them.”
