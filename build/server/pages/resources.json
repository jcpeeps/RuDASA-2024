In 2014 it became the Rural Health Conference as it had far outgrown it's original brief, and in 2017 it became a joint project with RuReSA, PACASA and RuNurSA.\r\n\r\nThe conference is a much-anticipated, vibrant forum which combines a mixture of sessions ranging from clinical skills updates for and by a wide range of health professionals to emotive discussions and workshops on issues such as justice and equity. The conference is ideal for exchanging ideas and is ideal for networking. Younger colleagues and students are also encouraged to attend.\r\n\r\nA highlight of the conference is the gala Dinner and Award Ceremony in which doctors, nurses, clinical associates and therapists are recognised for their outstanding role in rural health. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    This is a comment and is not displayed on the website.

There are a number of resources on NDoH Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs), National Core Standards (NCS), and Tools for Quality Improvement (QI). We recognise that you may be working in less than optimal situations and have identified organisations that can advocate for you when we cannot help you. Remember you can VOICE concerns on the Forum or contact the RuDASA Executive directly.\r\n\r\n## Getting Help for Advocacy\r\n \r\n### The VOICE Project\r\nThe Voice Project is part of RHAP and aims to improve access to quality rural health care by increasing the number and quality of healthcare provider change agents. As part of this initiative, RHAP provides free of charge CPD accredited Advocacy workshops in institutions of learning and at facility level.\r\n\r\n### The StopStockOuts Project\r\nThe Stop Stockouts Project (SSP) is a consortium of initiated by Section 27, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the Rural Health Advocacy Project (RHAP), Rural Health Doctors Association of Southern Africa (RuDASA), the Southern African HIV Clinician Society and the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) dedicated to assisting the thousands of people whose lives are threatened by the chronic shortages of essential medicines and children’s vaccines in South Africa. They have an annual survey and you can contact them to report Stockouts.\r\n\r\n### SECTION27\r\nSECTION27 is a public interest law centre that seeks to achieve substantive equality and social justice in South Africa. Guided by the principles and values in the Constitution, SECTION27 uses law, advocacy, legal literacy, research and community mobilisation to achieve access to healthcare services and basic education. SECTION27 aims to achieve structural change and accountability to ensure the dignity and equality of everyone.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    This is a comment and is not displayed on the website.
