It can be used as a structured program, or the resources can be accessed on an ad hoc basis. \r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\nA real-time course takes place annually in February /March over a 6-8 week period which includes weekly resource packs and online seminars.  But don’t worry if you missed it!  \r\nAll of the resources, as well as recordings of all our seminars, are available [here](/portal). You can follow the program at any time that suits you or you can  use the resources ad hoc to enhance your own learning journey. \r\n\r\n**The Weekly program is structured as follows:**\r\n1. **Week 1:** Infectious Diseases including HIV/TB\r\n2. **Week 2:** Maternal and Women’s health\r\n3. **Week 3:** Non-communicable disease care\r\n4. **Week 4:** Child & neonatal Health\r\n5. **Week 5:** Emergency Medicine\r\n6. **Week 6:** Anaesthetics / Orthopaedics / Surgery\r\n7. **Week 7:** Mental Health / Thriving in rural health care\r\n8. **Week 8:** Soft Skills / Health systems & QIP \r\n\r\n \r\n## Resources\r\nThe content of each week’s material includes the following:\r\n* Key topics in that area you need to be familiar with\r\n* Relevant guidelines and Topics\r\n* Recorded webinars, YouTube videos and relevant teaching material\r\n* Relevant articles \r\n* Tools and relevant websites with additional resources\r\n \r\nAt the moment the clinical part of the program is heavily focused on doctors and clinical associates, but the orientation package is open to *any* clinician in an EC rural health facility. The sections on employee support, the MDT team, health care worker mental health and patient centred care are particularly relevant to any cadre.\r\n<!--\r\n    This is a comment and is not displayed on the website.
